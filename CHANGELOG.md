# Changelog

All notable changes to GSD are documented in this file.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.7.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Model fallback support for auto-mode phases — if the configured model fails, GSD tries alternate models before stopping
- `/kill` command for immediate process termination

### Fixed
- `npm install -g gsd-pi` now works — workspace packages bundled in npm tarball via `bundleDependencies`
- External PI ecosystem packages (pi-rtk, pi-context, etc.) can now resolve `@mariozechner/*` imports through jiti aliases
- Missing `export-html` vendor files (marked.min.js, highlight.min.js) restored
- Skipped API keys now persist so the setup wizard doesn't repeat on every launch
- Provider config and extension loading reused correctly

### Changed
- `/exit` uses graceful shutdown (saves session state); `/kill` replaces the old immediate-exit behavior

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- Vendor Pi SDK source (tui, ai, agent-core, coding-agent) into workspace monorepo under `packages/`, replacing the compiled npm dependency and patch-package workflow. Pi internals are now directly modifiable as TypeScript source.
- Existing patches (setModel persist option, Windows VT input caching) applied as source edits.
- Build pipeline runs workspace packages in dependency order before GSD compilation.
- Removed `patch-package` from devDependencies and postinstall.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Proactive secret management — planning phase forecasts required API keys into a manifest; auto-mode collects pending secrets before dispatching the first slice
- `--continue` / `-c` CLI flag to resume the most recent session

### Fixed
- Doctor post-hook no longer preempts `complete-slice` dispatch
- `main_branch` preference restored; `runPreMergeCheck` implemented for merge safety
- Recovery/retry prompt injection capped to prevent V8 OOM on large sessions
- `.gsd/` excluded from pre-switch auto-commits to prevent squash merge conflicts

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- `secure_env_collect` now auto-detects existing keys, destination files, and provides guidance field for better onboarding UX

### Changed
- Right-sized pipeline for simple work — single-slice milestones skip redundant research/plan sessions, reducing 9-10 sessions to 5-6
- Heavyweight plan sections (Proof Level, Integration Closure, Observability) are now conditional, omitted for simple slices

### Fixed
- Squash-merge now aborts cleanly on conflict and stops auto-mode instead of looping with corrupted state
- Resolved baked-in merge conflict markers in loader.ts, logo.ts, and postinstall.js

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Native Anthropic web search — Claude models get server-side web search automatically, no Brave API key required
- GitService fully wired into codebase — programmatic git operations replace shell-based git commands in prompts
- Merge guards prevent slice completion when uncommitted changes or conflicts exist
- Snapshot support for saving and restoring `.gsd/` state
- Auto-push after slice squash-merge to main
- Rich commit messages with structured metadata

### Fixed
- State machine deadlock when units fail to produce expected artifacts — retry and cross-validation now gate completion
- Duplicate Brave search tools when toggling providers repeatedly
- Windows test glob patterns (single quotes → unquoted for shell expansion)
- Conversation replay error caused by thinking blocks in stored history
- Brave search tools removed from API payload when no `BRAVE_API_KEY` is set
- Restore notifications suppressed on session resume to reduce UX noise

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Automatic migration of provider credentials from existing Pi installations — skip re-authentication when switching to GSD
- Pi extensions from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` discoverable in interactive mode
- GitService core implementation for programmatic git operations

### Changed
- System prompt compressed by 48% (360 → 187 lines) for better context efficiency
- Refined agent character and communication style prompts
- Added craft standards, self-debugging awareness, and work narration to agent prompts

### Fixed
- RPC mode crash when `ctx.ui.theme` is undefined (#121)

## [2.3.11] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Branded clack-based onboarding wizard on first launch — LLM provider selection (OAuth + API key), optional tool API keys, and setup summary (#118)
- `gsd config` subcommand to re-run the setup wizard anytime
- Shared `src/logo.ts` module as single source of truth for ASCII banner

### Fixed
- Parallel subagent results no longer truncated at 200 characters

### Changed
- `wizard.ts` trimmed to env hydration only — onboarding logic moved to `onboarding.ts`
- First-launch banner removed from `loader.ts` (onboarding wizard handles branding)

## [2.3.10] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Branded postinstall experience with animated spinners, progress indicators, and clean summary (#115)

### Fixed
- Ctrl+Alt shortcuts (dashboard, bg manager, voice) now show slash-command fallback in terminals that lack Kitty keyboard protocol support — macOS Terminal.app, JetBrains IDEs (#100, #104)

## [2.3.9] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Tavily as alternative web search provider alongside Brave Search (#102)
- Auto-mode progress widget now shows all stats; footer hidden during auto-mode (#75)

### Fixed
- Auto-mode infinite loop and closeout instability — idempotent unit dispatch, retry caps, and atomic closeout (#96, #109)
- Migration no longer requires ROADMAP.md — milestones inferred from phases/ directory when missing (#93, #90)
- Worktree branch safety — proper namespacing and slice branch base selection (#92)
- Windows: use `execFile` to avoid single-quote shell issues (#103)
- Broken `read @GSD-WORKFLOW.md` references replaced with `/gsd` command (#88)
- Google Search extension updated to use `gemini-2.5-flash` (#83)
- Duplicate `getCurrentBranch` import in auto.ts (#87)
- `formatCost` crash on non-number cost values (#74)
- Avoid `sudo` prompts in postinstall script (#73)
- `.gsd/` folder removed from git tracking; consolidated `.gitignore` (#78)
- Multiple community-reported bugs across CLI, auto-mode, and extensions

## [2.3.8] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- Worktree file operations (Write, Read, Edit) now resolve paths against the active working directory instead of the launch directory (#72)
- Auto-mode merge guard handles all slice completion paths, preventing infinite dispatch loops when `complete-slice` is bypassed (#71)

## [2.3.7] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Remote user questions via Slack/Discord for headless auto-mode sessions

### Fixed
- Auto-mode model switches no longer persist as the user's global default (#30)
- Auto-mode resume now rebuilds disk state and runs doctor before dispatching, preventing inline execution after pause (#16)
- Silent dispatch failure when command context is null now surfaces an error notification
- Race condition between timeout handlers and prompt dispatch in auto-mode
- Remote questions: validate IDs before test-send, sanitize error messages to prevent token leakage
- Remote questions: cap user_note at 500 chars to prevent LLM context injection
- Remote questions: validate channel ID format to prevent SSRF
- Remote questions: add 15s per-request fetch timeout to adapters
- Remote questions: distinguish Discord 404 from auth errors in reactions
- Prompt store sorting uses `updatedAt` instead of filename
- TypeScript parameter properties desugared for `--experimental-strip-types` compatibility

### Changed
- Remote question result details use discriminated union type

## [2.3.6] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- Postinstall no longer triggers hidden `sudo` prompt on Linux — Playwright's `--with-deps` flag is no longer run automatically, preventing `npm install -g` from appearing to hang (#67)

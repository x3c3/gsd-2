# ADR-009 Implementation Plan

**Related ADR:** [ADR-009-orchestration-kernel-refactor.md](/Users/jeremymcspadden/Github/gsd-2/docs/dev/ADR-009-orchestration-kernel-refactor.md)  
**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** 2026-04-14  
**Target Window:** 8-10 waves (incremental, no big-bang rewrite)

## Objective

Implement ADR-009 by migrating GSD orchestration internals to a Unified Orchestration Kernel (UOK) with six control planes:

1. Plan
2. Execution
3. Model
4. Gate
5. GitOps
6. Audit

without breaking existing CLI/web/MCP workflows.

The first production-safe outcome is:

- existing auto-mode behavior remains stable
- new kernel contracts exist behind feature flags
- every turn is traceable with deterministic gate outcomes

## Non-Goals

- Rewriting user-facing command surfaces
- Replacing all legacy modules in a single PR
- Introducing new provider auth flows that bypass existing compliance boundaries
- Forcing `burn-max` behavior as default

## Constraints

- Maintain current runtime compatibility and defaults
- Preserve existing state-on-disk and DB-backed transition model
- Keep provider-agnostic behavior while enforcing provider-specific policy constraints
- All migration steps must be reversible behind flags
- High-risk changes require parity tests against existing behavior

- Implement turn transaction API
- Wire turn transactions into auto closeout path
- Add configurable `turn_action` and `turn_push` semantics

## Wave 8: Legacy Branch Retirement + Default Flip

Purpose: reduce maintenance burden and enable UOK as default.

Tasks:

- keep legacy fallback behind emergency flag for one release window
- update docs and preferences reference

Exit criteria:

- UOK default in stable channel
- no critical parity regressions in one full release cycle

Verification:

- full `npm test`
- smoke + integration suites
- targeted manual UAT for CLI/web/headless

## Testing and Validation Matrix

### 1. Unit

- contract serialization
- gate runner behavior by failure class
- model policy filter decisions
- git transaction state machine
- event envelope schema validation

### 2. Integration

- auto dispatch across plan/execute/complete/reassess/uat
- worktree/branch/none isolation behaviors
- parallel and reactive execution parity
- policy-denied dispatch fast-fail

### 3. End-to-End

- greenfield milestone from discuss -> plan -> execute -> complete -> merge
- failure reprocessing (test failure, tool failure, model failure)
- full audit trace reconstruction by `traceId`
- provider compliance scenarios (allowed vs denied paths)

### 4. Parity Harness

- replay selected historical workflows against legacy and UOK paths
- compare:
  - state transitions
  - produced artifacts
  - gate decisions
  - commit outcomes

## Rollout Strategy

### Stages

1. Internal dogfood with flags on
2. Beta cohort opt-in via project preference
3. General availability with flags default-on
4. Legacy fallback removed after stability window

### Safety Controls

- runtime kill-switch for each plane
- release-note explicit migration warnings
- auto-rollback trigger on critical regressions (gates, git integrity, state corruption)

## Data and Schema Changes

Expected schema additions:

- audit projection tables in `gsd.db`
- gate result persistence tables
- turn transaction metadata

Rules:

- additive migrations only until Wave 8
- keep backwards-compatible readers during migration window

## Dependencies

1. Stable contract definitions before gate/model/scheduler rewires
2. Gate plane before gitops hard enforcement
3. Model policy engine before enabling any-model-any-phase by default
4. Audit envelope before legacy logger removal
5. Plan v2 before enforcing front-loaded planning defaults

## Risk Register

### Risk 1: Hidden Coupling in Auto Loop

Impact: migration bugs due to implicit side effects.  
Mitigation: adapter-first extraction and parity harness before path switch.

### Risk 2: Parallel Deadlocks

Impact: blocked runs or inconsistent state.  
Mitigation: graph-level deadlock checks, IO lock tests, staged rollout behind flags.

### Risk 3: Git Noise / Team Workflow Friction

Impact: commit churn and review overhead.  
Mitigation: milestone squash defaults and configurable turn transaction modes.

### Risk 4: Policy Drift Across Providers

Impact: compliance regressions.  
Mitigation: provider policy registry tests and release checklist gates.

### Risk 5: Telemetry Volume Growth

Impact: storage/perf pressure in long-running projects.  
Mitigation: append-only raw + indexed projection + retention policies.

## Definition of Done (ADR-009)

ADR-009 is complete when all are true:

1. UOK path is default and stable.
2. All units execute through unified gate runner.
3. Model selection supports any eligible model in any phase with policy enforcement.
4. Hooks/agents/subagents/parallel/team execution runs through one scheduler contract.
5. Turn-level git transaction record exists for every executed turn.
6. Unified audit events provide causal traceability across orchestration, model, tool, git, and test actions.
7. Plan v2 can produce a complete unit graph with fail-closed plan gate.
8. `burn-max` profile is available and policy-safe.
9. Legacy orchestration branches are retired or behind emergency-only fallback.
10. CLI/web/headless behavior remains user-compatible.

## Recommended Immediate Next Tasks (Week 1)

1. Add Wave 0 feature flags and default-off wiring.
2. Introduce contract types and adapter shell (Wave 1 scaffolding).
3. Add parity telemetry capture for legacy loop baseline.
4. Land initial tests for contract serialization and turn result envelopes.

/**
 * Regression test for #3547: discuss and plan must be classified as
 * multi-turn commands in headless mode.
 *
 * Previously this test grep'd `headless.ts` for the literal identifier
 * `discuss` inside the `isMultiTurnCommand =` RHS, which would pass on a
 * comment, an unrelated string constant, or a regression that left the
 * identifier in place but stopped using it. The classifier is now an
 * exported pure function so we can call it directly.

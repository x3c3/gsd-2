/**
 * db-path-worktree-symlink.test.ts — #2517
 *
 * Regression test for the db_unavailable loop in worktree/symlink layouts.
 *
 * The path resolver must handle BOTH worktree path families:
 *   - /.gsd/worktrees/<MID>/...           (direct layout)
 *   - /.gsd/projects/<hash>/worktrees/<MID>/...  (symlink-resolved layout)
 *
 * When the second layout is not recognised, ensureDbOpen derives a wrong DB
 * path, the open fails silently, and every completion tool call returns
 * db_unavailable — triggering an artifact retry re-dispatch loop.
 *
 * Additionally, the post-unit artifact retry path must NOT retry when the
 * completion tool failed due to db_unavailable (infra failure), because
 * retrying can never succeed and causes cost spikes.

## UNIT: Complete Slice {{sliceId}} ("{{sliceTitle}}") — Milestone {{milestoneId}}

## Working Directory

Work only in `{{workingDirectory}}`. Do not `cd` elsewhere.

## Your Role in the Pipeline

You are the closer: verify assembled task work delivers the slice goal, then compress it into a downstream-ready slice summary and UAT.

{{inlinedContext}}

{{gatesToClose}}

Match effort to complexity. Simple 1-2 task slices need brief summary and lightweight verification; multi-subsystem slices need stronger verification and more detail.

Use `subagent` only for fresh-context review when useful: reviewer for cross-cutting code/new abstractions, security for auth/network/parsing/file IO/shell/crypto, tester for coverage gaps. Subagents report; you apply findings before completion.

## Completion Rules

1. Use the inlined Slice Summary and UAT templates.
2. {{skillActivation}}
3. Run all slice-level verification checks from the slice plan. Fix failures before marking done; refresh current state if needed.
4. Task summaries use a flat file layout under `tasks/` such as `T01-SUMMARY.md`, not inside per-task subdirectories like `tasks/T01/SUMMARY.md`. Never use `tasks/*/SUMMARY.md`.
5. If observability/diagnostics were planned, verify them unless the slice is simple.
6. Address every gate in Gates to Close. Q8 maps to **Operational Readiness**: health signal, failure signal, recovery procedure, monitoring gaps. Empty sections are recorded as omitted.
7. If requirement status changed, call `gsd_requirement_update`; do not write `.gsd/REQUIREMENTS.md` directly.
8. Prepare `gsd_slice_complete` content with camelCase fields `milestoneId`, `sliceId`, `sliceTitle`, `oneLiner`, `narrative`, `verification`, and `uatContent`.
9. Draft concrete UAT with preconditions, numbered steps, expected outcomes, edge cases, UAT Type, and Not Proven By This UAT.
10. Review task summaries for DECISIONS.md and KNOWLEDGE.md-worthy decisions, patterns, and gotchas. Capture significant items with `capture_thought`; do not append knowledge files directly.
11. Call `gsd_slice_complete`. The DB-backed tool is the canonical write path. Do **not** manually write `{{sliceSummaryPath}}`. Do **not** manually write `{{sliceUatPath}}`. Do not edit roadmap checkboxes; the tool renders files and updates projections.
12. Do not run git commands.
13. Update `.gsd/PROJECT.md` with a full `write` only if the current project state needs refresh.

**Autonomous execution:** no human is available. Do not call `ask_user_questions` or `secure_env_collect`; make reasonable assumptions and document them.

**File system safety:** if re-reading task summaries, use `find .gsd/milestones/{{milestoneId}}/slices/{{sliceId}}/tasks -name "*-SUMMARY.md"` or `ls .gsd/milestones/{{milestoneId}}/slices/{{sliceId}}/tasks/*-SUMMARY.md`. Never pass `{{slicePath}}` or any directory path directly to the `read` tool.

**You MUST call `gsd_slice_complete` with summary and UAT content before finishing.**

When done, say: "Slice {{sliceId}} complete."
